# Fun Tools ðŸ§¸

Welcome to the Fun Tools repository! This collection of scripts is designed to playfully (or maybe not so playfully) overwhelm a user's screen with pop-ups or create a mesmerizing Matrix-style rain effect. Use them responsibly!

## Tools Overview

### Blink Tool
**Files:** `blink.py`, `v2.sh`

These tools flood the user's screen with pop-up windows, creating an overload effect that forces the user to power off the machine due to the high number of processes. The `blink.py` is a Python script, while `v2.sh` is a shell script that achieves the same outcome.

### Matrix Shower
**Files:** `matrix.py`, `matrix.sh`

These scripts display a Matrix-style rain effect on the screen. The `matrix.py` is written in Python, and `matrix.sh` is a shell script that produces a similar visual effect.
